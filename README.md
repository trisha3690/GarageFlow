## 📌 Project Overview

This project allows users to perform basic operations on vehicle service data such as adding, viewing, updating, and deleting records.

It is built using standard Spring Boot architecture:

- Controller Layer (API endpoints)
- Service Layer (business logic)
- Repository Layer (database interaction)
- Model Layer (entity definition)
